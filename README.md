Tic-Tac-Toe

As users playing a two player game we want to:

    enter our names and have them displayed ✔
    have our order chosen for us by the game ✔
    take turns placing our marks in empty spaces ✔
    not be able to place our marks in an occupied space ✔
    be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw ✔
    start the game over without having to reset the browser ✔

As a user playing a one player game I want to:

    see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
    have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player with the correct mark in an empty space

As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted to:

    have the Computer make 'better-than-guessing' choices when placing a mark on the board
    set the board size myself ("wider" or "taller" than 3x3)
